# compass - start one `claude -p` session
# =============================================================================
# The one place Compass starts a model session (ADR-030). `compass run`
# calls it once per cycle, and the eval harness (`evals/harness.py`) calls it
# for every session it drives, so the two cannot drift into two launchers
# with different arguments or different handling of a hung session.
#
# It starts the process and returns what came back. It reads no credential
# and adds none: the caller's environment is passed on as it is.
#
# DEPENDENCY: standard library (json, os, selectors, signal, subprocess, sys,
# threading, time).
